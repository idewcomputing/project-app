# 2 DESIGN & BUILD SOLUTION

## Driving Question:  What solution will you offer and how will you design and build it?

Generate multiple prototypes for a solution. Evaluate and refine your prototypes through internal review and stakeholder feedback, in order to select a specific design to build. Define the specific features of the solution, in order to develop a pilot version based on the available time and resources. Build or code your solution in iterative stages. Internally test your solution to verify its quality and identify any issues. Continually track your progress to finish on time.
