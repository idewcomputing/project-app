# 3 Evaluate & Refine Solution

## Driving Question:  How effective is your solution and how will you improve it?

Evaluate the quality and value of your solution through stakeholder testing and feedback. Analyze the evaluation data to determine how well the solution met the design goals and to identify issues that may require further improvements. As time and resources allow, implement feasible improvements. \_\_Demonstrate and present your project to a public audience to share the innovations and value provided by your solution to your targeted problem. Explain the process used to design, build, and evaluate your solution. Reflect on how the project experience impacted your personal development and your future educational and career interests.
