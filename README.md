# Challenge and Background

## Challenge

In teams, you will design and code a working web app. The app must be original and help users solve a problem. The app should be developed for use at home, work, and/or school. 

## Background

You will work with your team members to decide on a topic for your web app. It could be one of the topics below or another one of your choosing.

### Topics to Consider

* Shopping
* Music
* Education
* Social Media
* Utilities \(Calculator, Weather, etc.\)
* Entertainment
* Travel
* News

### 

### Teams

Teams of 3 students will collaborate to design and code the web-based app. Each team will be responsible for determining member roles \(Project Manager, Code Lead, Art Lead\), maintaining good communication, ensuring equitable contributions, and providing clear project updates to the class in a timely manner.



### Technology

You will code your web app using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Teams will begin with a very basic ****framework to build their customized solution. 



### Final Deliverables

Each stage of the project has a set of deliverables, but they lead up to the following final deliverables from the team.

* **A web app** that has been tested, refined, and prepared for demonstration at the semester-end event with the following minimum requirements.
  * A unique style created by the team.
  * The app must solve a problem and have multiple functions.
* **A poster** \(2’ x 3’\) summarizing the process of creating your web app \(including artifacts created, like sketches, prototypes etc.\), along with defining features of the final design.
* **A well-coordinated presentation** that demonstrates the web app and explains the process of developing it to visitors of your school.
* **A prepared personal perspective** for you, as an individual, to share your unique responsibilities and experiences during the project, including how your future goals and interests have been shaped.



### Recommended Production Tools

* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) - for team file management and Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drawings.
* [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) - For code environment for tutorial apps and your final web app.
* [Marvel App](https://marvelapp.com) - A digital prototyping tool.
* Analog Tools - Paper, pencils, markers, whiteboards, and sticky notes are valuable on any day.
* Digital Camera / Phone - Photographs of sketches, paper notes and whiteboard notes.



### Why Do This Project?

Of course you are going to create a great app, but you will also get first-hand experience in informatics and computing that reflect great opportunities in the field. You will...

* **Build skills** in the digital arts and programming.
* **Collaborate with a team** where tech skills, people skills, and design skills overlap.
* **Increase your intuition, confidence, and curiosity** in solving problems using a ‘_design, build and test_’ pattern common with scientific thinking, creative thinking, and critical thinking.



### What's Different About This?



This is different than learning from a textbook. While you are encouraged to complete tutorials in a particular skill area to build expertise, this project will challenge you in the following ways.

* **Independent and Interdependent Learning** - You will often have to search out information on your own, experiment, make mistakes, and try again. You will also do this in groups with peers, mentors, teachers, and professionals.
* **Managing Ambiguity** - Since you will be creating a unique solution, you will not be given a recipe on how to complete many tasks. You will often evaluate the context of problems quickly and decide on a plan of action that makes sense.
* **Collaborating** - You will have to be a productive team member, fulfilling a role, communicating clearly, and valuing each team member's views at decision points.
* **Presentation** - Your team will often present work to the class, and occasionally to visitors, to get feedback and share ideas with other teams.
